The soil moisture for each pixel can thus be retrieved using the following function:
Mv(i,j,NDVI,d)=(ΔσNDVI(i,j)/f(NDVI))(Mvmax−Mvmin)+Mvmin(i,j,d)
SMOS low-resolution moisture products (SMOS Level 3 daily product), corresponding to the one-year period of S1 acquisitions, were used to estimate Mvmax and Mvmin, since we do not want to use any ground measurements. The mean S1 radar signal is estimated over a SMOS pixel (40 km × 40 km).
